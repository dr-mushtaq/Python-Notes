        "Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level programming language that Google, Facebook, NASA, and almost all other multinational companies worldwide use. Python has overtaken every language in recent years and has become the most popular and widely used programming language globally.\n",
        "Its popularity on the job market has grown to the extent that companies have made Python a requirement in their job postings. According to the Times of India, Python was among the top 5 highest-paid programming languages in 2021.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.\n",
        "Python can be used for everything from web development to Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and Data Science.\n",
        "Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require you to worry about syntax. Writing in Python is almost equal to written English. You have to use the proper functions or \"modules\" and let Python do the rest.\n",
        "The easy syntax of Python makes it great for beginners who are learning how to code and seasoned developers who want to quickly create software prototypes and earn a reasonable amount of income.\n",
        "Without wasting further time, let us get into the real business\n",
        "\n",
        "#**1.2-Why is it called ‘Python’?[4]**\n",
        "While many people assume the name Python Programming comes from something related to the Python snake, it actually comes from the TV comedy series ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus.’ This series broadcast on the BBC channelin the United Kingdom in the 1970s and was a favorite of Guido Van Rossum’s. Because it was short, cryptic, and included the name of his favorite TV comedy show, he chose the name ‘Python.’\n",
        "\n",
        "#**1.3-Python does not require a compiler[4]**\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted language that does not require a compiler, unlike other programming languages such as Java and C++.Python code is stored in a .py file, which serves as the Python engine and eliminates the need for a compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "#**1.4-Python is one of Google’s official programming languages[4]**\n",
        "Python is one of the few programming languages that has been designated as an official Google language. Python became one of Google’s official programming languages due of its efficiency. It was advantageous to them because it is simple to use, even on large projects. Even YouTube is powered by Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "#**1.5-Python is similar to English[4]**\n",
        "Many people claim that Python is a simple language to learn. The fundamental reason for this claim is that Python is more similar to English than other programming languages. It’s simple to figure out what each line of code accomplishes. Everything is simple and straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "#**1.6-Wide range of aspects[4]**\n",
        "Python is a general-purpose programming language. In fact, it can be used in a wide range of coding scenarios like web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, internet of things and many more."
