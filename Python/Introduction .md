##  **Software Categories**

**1. System Software**
   
System software provides the foundation for running hardware and application software. It helps manage computer resources and enables basic functions of the system.

**Key Features:**

- Directly interacts with hardware.

- Acts as a bridge between hardware and application software.

- Provides basic functions like memory management, device control, and file management.

**Examples:**

- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

- Device Drivers: Graphics driver, printer driver

- Utility Software: Disk cleaners, antivirus programs

**Purpose:**

- To ensure the smooth operation of the computer hardware.

- rovide essential tools for software developers.

**2. Application Software**

Application software refers to programs that perform specific tasks for the user, often built on top of system software.

**Key Features**

- User-focused: Designed to solve specific tasks or problems.

- Operates within the environment provided by system software.

- Ranges from simple tools to complex solutions.

**Examples**

- Productivity Software: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)

- Media Players: VLC, Windows Media Player

- Web Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox

- Graphics Software: Photoshop, Illustrator

- Enterprise Software: ERP, CRM systems

**Purpose**

To perform user-specific tasks, such as word processing, browsing, gaming, or multimedia editing.

### **1-What is meant by programming** 

Computer programming is how people can communicate and interact with computers. Learn about some common programming languages and steps to begin building experience.

**Definitions**:

1-  A program is a sequence of instructions that designate how to execute a computation

2- A program is a precise sequence of steps to solve a particular problem

3- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It‚Äôs like writing a recipe, but instead of making a cake, you‚Äôre creating different apps.

4-Programming is taking a task and writing it down in program language that a computer can understand and execute. The activity of telling the computer to do something for us. There are more than 1000 programming languages.

5-Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Think of it like writing a recipe‚Äînot for baking a cake, but for solving problems or building tools with code.

**Concept**

As a computer user you know that computers don‚Äôt have feelings. They don‚Äôt work any faster or slower depending on if we‚Äôre angry at them or if we‚Äôre happy.
Computers can perform millions of calculations per second, but they require us to tell them exactly what to do. If you want a computer to perform a useful task, you need to write a program, as computers do not understand instructions the way we do.

The primary distinction between programming and familiar tasks is that instead of clicking buttons to perform actions, we write instructions in a programming language. Most programming languages are composed of English words, numbers, and various characters that carry special meanings.
We all have to deal with a certain task in daily life and many. We can solve our own problems, while others which are especially complicated can be solved with the help of a computer.

If there is a daily life problem First you define a problem that you want to solve and then if you know all the steps then you can easily solve. If you want to solve this problem with a computer and you give these steps to the computer in English, the computer will not understand it and it understands 0,1 only and no other symbol and similar to  a switch and it only recognizes two phases On and off  and to solve this Problem you need to write a program .
