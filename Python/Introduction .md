### **1-What is meant by programming** 

Computer programming is how people can communicate and interact with computers. Learn about some common programming languages and steps to begin building experience.

Definitions:
A program is a sequence of instructions that designate how to execute a computation
A program is a precise sequence of steps to solve a particular problem
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It‚Äôs like writing a recipe, but instead of making a cake, you‚Äôre creating different apps.
Programming is taking a task and writing it down in program language that a computer can understand and execute. The activity of telling the computer to do something for us. There are more than 1000 programming languages.
Concept
As a computer user you know that computers don‚Äôt have feelings. They don‚Äôt work any faster or slower depending on if we‚Äôre angry at them or if we‚Äôre happy.
Computers can perform millions of calculations per second, but they require us to tell them exactly what to do. If you want a computer to perform a useful task, you need to write a program, as computers do not understand instructions the way we do.
The primary distinction between programming and familiar tasks is that instead of clicking buttons to perform actions, we write instructions in a programming language. Most programming languages are composed of English words, numbers, and various characters that carry special meanings.
We all have to deal with a certain task in daily life and many. We can solve our own problems, while others which are especially complicated can be solved with the help of a computer.
If there is a daily life problem First you define a problem that you want to solve and then if you know all the steps then you can easily solve. If you want to solve this problem with a computer and you give these steps to the computer in English, the computer will not understand it and it understands 0,1 only and no other symbol and similar to  a switch and it only recognizes two phases On and off  and to solve this Problem you need to write a program .
