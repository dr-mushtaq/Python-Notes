# **Software Categories**

## **1. System Software**
   
System software provides the foundation for running hardware and application software. It helps manage computer resources and enables basic functions of the system.

**Key Features:**

- Directly interacts with hardware.

- Acts as a bridge between hardware and application software.

- Provides basic functions like memory management, device control, and file management.

**Examples:**

- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

- Device Drivers: Graphics driver, printer driver

- Utility Software: Disk cleaners, antivirus programs

**Purpose:**

- To ensure the smooth operation of the computer hardware.

- rovide essential tools for software developers.

## **2. Application Software**

Application software refers to programs that perform specific tasks for the user, often built on top of system software.

**Key Features**

- User-focused: Designed to solve specific tasks or problems.

- Operates within the environment provided by system software.

- Ranges from simple tools to complex solutions.

**Examples**

- Productivity Software: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)

- Media Players: VLC, Windows Media Player

- Web Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox

- Graphics Software: Photoshop, Illustrator

- Enterprise Software: ERP, CRM systems

**Purpose**

To perform user-specific tasks, such as word processing, browsing, gaming, or multimedia editing.

# **What is meant by programming** 

Computer programming is how people can communicate and interact with computers. Learn about some common programming languages and steps to begin building experience.

**Definitions**:

1-  A program is a sequence of instructions that designate how to execute a computation

2- A program is a precise sequence of steps to solve a particular problem

3- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It‚Äôs like writing a recipe, but instead of making a cake, you‚Äôre creating different apps.

4-Programming is taking a task and writing it down in program language that a computer can understand and execute. The activity of telling the computer to do something for us. There are more than 1000 programming languages.

5-Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Think of it like writing a recipe‚Äînot for baking a cake, but for solving problems or building tools with code.

## **Concept**

As a computer user you know that computers don‚Äôt have feelings. They don‚Äôt work any faster or slower depending on if we‚Äôre angry at them or if we‚Äôre happy.
Computers can perform millions of calculations per second, but they require us to tell them exactly what to do. If you want a computer to perform a useful task, you need to write a program, as computers do not understand instructions the way we do.

The primary distinction between programming and familiar tasks is that instead of clicking buttons to perform actions, we write instructions in a programming language. Most programming languages are composed of English words, numbers, and various characters that carry special meanings.
We all have to deal with a certain task in daily life and many. We can solve our own problems, while others which are especially complicated can be solved with the help of a computer.

If there is a daily life problem First you define a problem that you want to solve and then if you know all the steps then you can easily solve. If you want to solve this problem with a computer and you give these steps to the computer in English, the computer will not understand it and it understands 0,1 only and no other symbol and similar to  a switch and it only recognizes two phases On and off  and to solve this Problem you need to write a program .

# **Critical Skills**

1. üß† Analytical Thinking
Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts

3. üßê Critical Thinking
Evaluate multiple solutions and select the most efficient one.

4- üëÄ Attention to Detail
Spot syntax errors, logical flaws, and data inconsistencies

5- üõ†Ô∏è Design Recipe for Programming
To design a program properly, follow these systematic steps:

6- üîç Analyze the Problem Statement
Understand the core goal and requirements.
Break the problem down into smaller, well-defined sub-problems.
Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints.
üìå Example: If the problem is to calculate a student‚Äôs GPA, clarify what inputs are given (grades, credit hours) and what output is expected (numeric GPA).

2. üß† Abstract the Essence of the Problem
Represent the problem logically and generally, not just with specific cases.

Create examples of input and output to understand the transformation.
üìå Example: For GPA, use test data:
Input: [(A, 3), (B+, 4)] ‚Üí Output: 3.5 GPA
3. üßæ Formulate in Precise Language
Write comments, function headers, and data contracts.
Use clear variable names, pseudo-code, or even flowcharts.

Describe:

What the function does

What it takes as input

What it returns

4. ‚úÖ Evaluate and Revise Using Tests
Design test cases for both expected and edge cases.

Run the program and compare output with expected results.

Refactor or improve code based on failures or inefficiencies.

 # **Source code or human-readable code**
 
 To communicate real-life problems to computers you need to create a specific type of text called source code or human-readable code that software can read and process to the computer in zero or one form

 # **Why Do We Need Programming?**

 You can‚Äôt just ask a computer, ‚ÄúHey, sort my files.‚Äù It only understands 1s and 0s (binary). So, we use programming languages like Python or Java to write instructions, which are later translated into machine code.

Without programming, a computer is just expensive hardware. With programming, it becomes a tool for:

- Automating tasks
-  Making decisions
-  nalyzing data
-  unning apps and websites

We act as the middle layer‚Äîbetween users and machines‚Äîby writing the logic that turns user input into useful output.

The hardware itself is not all that intelligent. And our job as programmers is to act as intermediaries between the hardware and the user to build something wonderful and beautiful. And so, you can kind of imagine that your job as a programmer is to intermediate between the hardware and the end user.

And so as a programmer, you‚Äôre going to write code and that code is going to use data, networks, and CPUs, and memory, and then do something for the user.

 Well, a program is like a sequence of stored instructions. And the idea is that the computer itself at the lowest level in the hardware is just not that smart. But it has a lot of flexibility in that if we give it the right instructions, it can do amazing things. If we give it right instructions to listen to voice, digitize the voice, and make sense of the voice, then you can write a program that can "hear". The computer doesn't hear, the program hears.
